# OneButton

This project started as a single button KaKu (http://www.klikaanklikuit.nl/home/) controller. 
Then it grew to a four button control center.
And at last... A TWELVE BUTTON COMMAND CONTROL CENTER!

It uses the standard KaKu protocol to switch the KaKu switches, it also uses the VirtualWire library to control an LED strip.
